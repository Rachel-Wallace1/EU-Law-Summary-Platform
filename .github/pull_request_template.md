# THIS IS A COMMENTED OUT SESSION, 
# DON'T WORRY ABOUT ERASING IT, AS IT WON'T MAKE IT TO THE ACTUAL COMMIT MESSAGE.
#
# TO MAKE THIS TEMPLATE THE BASIS OF ALL COMMIT MESSAGES ACROSS YOUR LOCAL MACHINE,
# RUN "git config --global commit.template ~/.gitmessage.txt" AFTER COPYING THIS FILE
# TO YOUR HOME DIRECTORY. IF YOU ONLY WANT IT TO APPLY TO THIS REPO, RUN
# "git config commit.template .gitmessage.txt" FROM THE ROOT OF THIS REPO.
# 
# Here's some quick tips on how to use markdown. 
#
#
# FORMATTING: 
#
# **bold text**
# *italic text*
# 
# General tips for readability:
#
# - Use tick's to highlight classes and other technical terms.
#   eg.: Change behavior on `Activity` class.
#
# - You can have a code highlighted block by using triple ticks: 
#    ```kotlin 
#           class Audible { 
#                fun times()
#           }
#     ```
#
# - You can add an image to the commit. The image can be on the project repository, or or Amazon Drive.
#   eg: This is how the new menu looks like : ![new menu](https:///..blablabla.jpg)
